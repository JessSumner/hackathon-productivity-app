    We are a team of new developers. We are all at the starting out in the web
    development field. We have all been learning in different ways: through
    bootcamps (online and in-person), online tutorials, books and just hacking
    away. We built this for practice working collaboratively. We want to help 
    other newbies learn and develop their skills and we hope this app helps.
